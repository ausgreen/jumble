# Jumble

Jumbles is a quick python program I made while working on some word jumbles with my grandmother.
My grandmother finished the jumbles before I finished the script and said "See, I don't need a computer to do my work for me."

### Anyway, on to the usage:

Install requirements using pip
    
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Run the program with each jumble you want solved as arguments separated by spaces.  Solutions will be returned as a list of lists.

    $ python jumble.py <jumble-1> <jumble-2> ... <jumble-n>
e.g.

    $ python jumble.py areop cefta cugorh limyte
    [['opera'], ['facet'], ['grouch'], ['timely']]
